## About

Hey! I am a masters student interested in the world of data science. Through my course I have learnt how to analyse and discover new information using R, Python and SQL, however, I would be strongest in R in which I find statistical analysis easiest. 

I have strong Excel skills from my time in industry at Mercer working as a data analyst. In Mercer I had to work with complex pensions formula and in large workbooks. As well as this I have good problem solving a trouble shooting skills in Excel. Similarly, a mixture of the masterâ€™s course and remote learning has meant that several projects completed this year have required a large amount of independent problem-solving skills.

In report generation, all the projects that I worked on were completed through R Markdown. Through this data visualisation and a professional look were the goal. The reports produced were a mixture of pdf, word documents and html files. Each with incorporated graphs and tables which were easily reproducible in the event of changing data. As an extension of this outside the course I have created this website using R markdown and the reports are included with the source code.
